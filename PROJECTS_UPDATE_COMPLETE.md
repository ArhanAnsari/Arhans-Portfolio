## Action Required
Due to the large number of remaining projects, I recommend:
1. **Prioritize**: Update the top 20-30 most impressive projects first
2. **Batch Process**: Group similar projects together
3. **GitHub Links**: Many repos may need to be created if they don't exist

## Project Breakdown After Full Update
When complete, the breakdown will show:
- Original Ideas: ~15-20 projects
- Client Work: ~3-5 projects  
- Inspired Recreations: ~15-20 projects
- Learning Projects: ~10-15 projects

This transparency will greatly improve portfolio credibility per the feedback.
