# Portfolio Improvements - October 2025

## üéØ Feedback Addressed

### 1. **Skills Section Overhaul** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Progress bars without meaningful context (What does 100% or 98% really mean?)
**Solution**: 
- Removed percentage-based progress bars
- Added meaningful metrics: Years of experience, Number of projects completed
- Included specific technologies for each skill area
- Added descriptive context for each skill

**Example**: Instead of "Node.js 98%", now shows:
- "Backend Development" 
- "RESTful APIs and real-time applications"
- "2+ years experience, 30+ projects"
- Technologies: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

- Added GitHub repository links to all projects
